HMM is better than the original non-sequence model because it converges much more faster. As one can imagine, dynamic model learning in a non-sequential setting is much more difficult than in the sequential setting and has not been thoroughly studied. 
After running the experiments with different number of states (from states = 2 to 7) , the plots (attached as analysis.png) of experiments shows that the best number of states is 4 or 5. 
The dev log likelihood is relatively small than other conditions when the number of states equal to 2. With states equal to 3, the model converges much more slower than other models with different states amount. In 4th plot and 5th plot, correspond to the model with states amount equal to 4 and 5, the dev log likelihood and training log likelihood grows faster in the beginning, and then keep steady after about iterations of 8. However, the dev log likelihood goes up and then falls gradually when the number of states equal to 6 and 7, which means that with more and more clusters, the model starts to overfit to the training data. Therefore, we can interpret that the relatively ideal number of states in the data is no more than 5.
